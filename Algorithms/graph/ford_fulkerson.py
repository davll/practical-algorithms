# Maximum flow problem
#
#   flow(u,v): the amount of flow on the edge from u to v
#
# Constraints:
#    1. Capacity constraint: flow(u, v) <= caps(u, v)
#    2. Non-negative value: flow(u, v) >= 0
#    3. Skew symmetry: flow(v, u) = -flow(u, v)
#    4. Conservation: sum { flow(u,i) for i in V/{s,t} } = 0
#
# undirected edge to directed edge:
#   -> two directed edges u -> v and v -> u
#   -> individual capacity: caps[v][u] = caps[u][v]
