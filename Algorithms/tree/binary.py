# Binary Tree
#
# 1. every node has at most two children
#

# Full Binary Tree
#
# 1. every node has either 0 or 2 children

# Complete Binary Tree
#
# 1. every level (except possibly the last) is completely filled
# 2. all nodes are as far left as possible

# Perfect Binary Tree
#
# 1. all internal nodes have two children
# 2. all leaves are at the same level

# Balanced Binary Tree
#
# 1.

# Degenerate/Pathological Tree


# Binary Search Tree
#
# 1. the key in each node >= any keys in the left sub-tree
# 2. the key in each node <= any keys in the right sub-tree
# 3. the leaves contain no key
